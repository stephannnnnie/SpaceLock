### GameIntro

SpaceLock is a physics-based 3D-platformer survival game where the player must navigate through floating objects while being pulled away from the end goal. The player uses a mouse-controlled grapple, pointing the cursor at objects and clicking to latch onto them. Objects within the grappleâ€™s maximum length are highlighted in green. Players have a limited number of grapples, each with a fixed maximum length, requiring strategic resource management. The goal is to reach the end goal of the level before being either pulled away or pushed into a wall, making quick, precise decisions under pressure crucial for survival.  In addition to aid the player in traversing the levels we have added power-ups that give the player additional grapples or increase the radius the grapples can reach!
